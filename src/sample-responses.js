      "description_original": "You asked some tough questions, and today I\u2019ve got answers! I recently put out a post on Instagram to all of you, asking: What would you like to know about how I built my business? The response was amazing! You all sent in SO many questions and today, I\u2019m going to answer 10 of them. I tried picking topics that I haven\u2019t covered all that much on previous episodes, and that would resonate with as many as you as possible. Here are those 10 questions: #1: If you burned it all down &amp; started over, what are the first 3 things you\u2019d focus on &amp; do now? (This one was a super timely one!) #2: What did you do when your email list was TINY? I mean less than 100, like mine \ud83d\ude05. How did you interact with your small community? (It all started with me underpromising, and overdelivering\u2026) #3: When you have multiple awesome projects you\u2019re working on, how do you prioritize? (Shout out to my project management tool, Asana!) #4: In hindsight, what is one thing you wish you would have done sooner? (If you\u2019re a loyal listener, you know the painful answer to this one!) #5: How do you set boundaries for quality family time and one on one time? (I need to be open and honest: I work on this every single day.) #6: Have you veered off course and how did you know when to get back on course or go ahead in that different direction? (So I\u2019ve never been big on chasing shiny objects, but I also get too comfortable sometimes\u2026) #7: How did you originally grow your podcast audience? What specifically did you leverage? Or was it purely organic? (I would say it was about two years before the podcast was doing amazing things.) #8: Apart from weekly consistent content what moved the success needle for you? (This one was REALLY hard for me at first\u2026) #9: What do you do in the moments when you doubt yourself? (For me, I just keep doing\u2026) #10: Which mentor do you credit for making the biggest impact in creating the biz you \u2764\ufe0f today? (A little tribute to my mom and dad, and how I got the best of both worlds.) I really hope this episode proves valuable to you. I\u2019m sharing a little bit of what\u2019s in my secret sauce, and I and my wish is that it inspires you to kick butt in your business. Don\u2019t forget to check out the links at the bottom of this page. I couldn\u2019t get to all of the questions, so I\u2019ve listed some resource podcasts down below as an additional tool for you! Now, let\u2019s dive in! Let\u2019s get your burning questions answered! This episode is sponsored by my free masterclass, \u201cThe Ultimate List Building Catch-Up Plan: My Proven 3-Stack System For Leveraging The Most Powerful, \u201cWhat\u2019s Working Now\u201d List Building Strategies (without the stress, tech confusion, or crazy overwhelm).
