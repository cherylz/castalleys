## What Users Can Do with CastAlleys

Just search for what you want to listen to and you are ready to play the show. You can use it on your phone without having to download an extra app since it's a progressive web app. To add some fun when enjoying its simplicity, you can choose what color you want the app in (only applicable to non-touchscreen users at this moment).

## Technologies

* Written in React, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.
* Built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router), and [Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/).
* Deployed to [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
* Others: Non-sensitive data is stored in the [local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) of a web browser. [_.debounce from Lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#debounce) is used to create a debounced function to delay certain API requests.

## Installation

* Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
* Get your freemium X-RapidAPI-Key from https://rapidapi.com/ to be able to call the [ListenNotes API](https://rapidapi.com/listennotes/api/listennotes).
* Create a file named `apiKey.js` in the `src` folder. Paste this line `export const apiKey = "key";` into the file and replace the string key with your key grabbed from the previous step.
* Run `npm start` to make edits in the development mode.

## Behind the Scenes

### Why I Built CastAlleys

CastAlleys was built as a capstone project for an online coding bootcamp ([Altcademy](https://www.altcademy.com/)) I enrolled. My goals for this project were to build something at least I would use (I like podcasts) and something that allowed me to practice what I had learned and challenged me to learn more.

### User Stories

* Some podcast listeners who use computers more often than mobile phones want to search and play a show directly from their computer, without the need to take out their phone, unlock the screen and open an app. They will find CastAlleys handy to use since it is optimized for web users.
* There are also podcast listeners who want to keep their mobile apps to the minimum. They can use CastAlleys on their phone's home screen without downloading it since it is a progressive web app.

### Features

* Podcast search.
* Episode search with matched keyword(s) highlighted in titles, descriptions and transcripts.
* Episode search within a given podcast.
* Customizable theme color.
* Podcast streaming with playback controls.
* Podcast page view.
* Episode page view.

### Wireframes

In case you are interested in checking out wireframes, here are the sketches of the main interfaces I made with pen and paper for large screens: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10Y-2lI5bnXj8i2oV2Je0K8V1IdShHSvk?usp=sharing. For small screens, I coded the design.

### General Approach

#### Planning

* Steps: generate the idea, plan for the scope of work and timeline, make wireframes for main pages, plan for the component hierarchy in React, and set up the file structure based on the hierarchy.

#### Building

* Major steps: Build a static version. Then move on to build an interactive version by adding features one at a time.
* For each major step, repeat the process of 'build, test, deploy, debug, commit to GitHub'.

#### Quality

* For improving the app quality, [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) was used to audit pages.
* For improving the code quality, [ESLint with Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) were used.
